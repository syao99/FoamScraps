A printed bolt system for short-dart Caliburns and Talon Claws that should mostly clear the lips of a talon mag, while providing better airflow for performance.

Future design updates:
- Lathe for a smoother transition from magazine section to barrel seal section, maintain maximum possible surface area possible.
- Switch barrel seal section to a separate part - a thin section of TPU glued onto the rest of the assembly, instead of using O-ring. This would result in more durability without requiring a thin, airflow-constricting section for the O-ring, while providing a seal on-par.
